ArduinoController 
============================================
The ArduinoController encapsulate the arduino boards used with the ArrayBot software. It acts as a socket server where
clients can connect and subscribe to messages regarding the perhipheral hardware. Messages can be sent to the 
controller in order to make the hardware do something, like changing the light and execute the puffer.
