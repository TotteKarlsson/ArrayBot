=======================
* Added position ranges for each motor
* Fixed Paired move known bugs
* Implemented Button 14 on PS4 controller to do the lift
* Added getMaxPosition function motors

Release 0.5.7 (Jun 8)
=======================
* Added lifting code
* Updated UI with updated notification of angles and lift action
* Fixed reading writing of lift parameters
* New class implementing a PairedMove
* Refactoring

Release 0.5.6 (Jun 8)
=======================
* Added cycling of speeds and XY stages enabled

* Added code to handle an absent JoyStick

Release 0.5.4 (Jun 6)
=======================
* Fixed issues with enabled/disabled motors.
* Added ability to enable/disable motors
* A motor does sometime get disabled, for various reasons. When disabled, no current is
* holding the motor so moving the motor manually is ok (I guess).

* Renamed formname

* Cleaned up

* Adding another angle controller to ArrayBot
* Renaming spatialMove to LinearMove
* Added more doxygen docs
* More move/process logic
* Added/rename Process sequencer, more abstract than MoveSequencer
* Added process class, abstract class for a process to be used with the
* Process sequencer
* Adding logic to ProcessSequencer
* Achieved a simple UI sequencer
* Refactoring: moveToPosition -> moveAbsolute
* Fixing up cyclic header dependencies
